Hi, I’m Alexis
About Me

I am a data analyst with a background in administration, customer service, and business management. In those roles, I regularly worked with reports, performance tracking, and operational data, which pushed me toward analytics as a way to answer business questions more effectively.

I recently completed a Data Technician Bootcamp where I built hands on projects using Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel. Across these projects, I worked with datasets ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 plus records, focusing on data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and automation to support decision making.

What motivates me most is taking messy data, asking the right questions, and turning it into something clear that others can act on.
